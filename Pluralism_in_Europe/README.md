## Who believes in diversity and what values do they share? 

To answer this question, I've explored freely available results from the European Social Survey (2018 edition) and in particular its 21-item measure of human values designed by Shalom H. Schwartz.

I’ve compared results from the UK, France and Germany. Which led to some important questions regarding diversity and its meaning, discrimination and its impact on people’s values.

I’m taking a broad definition of pluralism here: pluralists are people believing that diversity is a good thing for society. Pluralists are people who value not just specific differences but all of them. It is thus not enough to sympathize with a specific community or minority group to be considered a pluralist. Pluralists value difference whatever form it takes.

- [Part 3: Pluralism, Race and Ethnicity](3_Pluralism_Race&Ethnicity.ipynb)

Please feel free to comment and contribute, this is only a first exploration with many opportunities for improvement and additional insight!
